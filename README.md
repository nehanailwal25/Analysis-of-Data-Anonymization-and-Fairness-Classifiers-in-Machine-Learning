# Analysis-of-Data-Anonymization-and-Fairness-Classifiers-in-Machine-Learning

This is the implementaton of fairness processings (pre, in and post) using Feldman, Zafar and Kamiran algorithms.

Data was fed into all the Fairness models as described above for processing the it and generate a fair copy of data according to all forms of fairness.
* The fair copy of data collected from running the fairness Algorithms was Kept for further processing.
* Correction and fairness matrices were calculated for all the ypes of fairness algorithms.
* K-Anonymization algorithm was run with original raw ataset and results were collected.
* Again, K-Anonymization algorithm was triggered by providing the fair copy of data collected from Step-3.
* Results obtained from both forms of data by running in K-anonymity were collected and analyzed.
